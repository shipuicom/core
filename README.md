# âœ¨ Sparkle UI

### Testing to add

### Blocked changes

- [ ] required inputs on dialogs, since its not supported by angular yet [angular/51878](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/51878)

### Notes

- For safari `<18` the selects does not support using options so you must use `<spk-option>` instead of `<option>` (this is fixed in the next select version currently suffixed with `-new`)
- Known issues for selects when having two selects editing the same value and it is a multi select and searchable they clear out when opened also when selecting a new item they clear the rest of the list - not a very likely scenario but it is something to keep in mind (Your UI probably should not allow this scenario write an issue if you think it should be possible with a good explanation and example)
